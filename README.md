# Pay10ad Dumper

Feature-rich Android OTA payload dumper written in Rust.

> What is Payload?
> Android payload is a file that contains ROM partitions like boot, system, vendor and others. Payload Dumper extracts these partitions from the `payload.bin` file.

## 🪄 Features

- Extract partitions **selectively** (Specify via `-p`/`--partitions`)
- Extract from local `payload.bin` or ROM **zip** file without decompressing the whole archive
- Extract from **HTTP(S) URL** (`payload.bin` or zip) without downloading the whole file (Need server support)
- Verify output partitions
- Parallelism to maximize speed (Customizable via `--no-parallel`/`--threads`)

## 📥 Installation

### Using [`binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall)
